## Problem:

In the current scenario we see the whole world is going through this pandemic Covid19. Everyone is giving their best to fight this pandemic, one of the major category being our doctors. But in reality their are many factors which can be helpful for our doctors. Stating an example: In our Rural area there are many outsiders coming from different state and before entering the area, Screening is compulsory, to screen huge amount of patients, doctors need the required kits but the kits are limited, so it’s very risky for doctors as well as the patients because of which they are unable to screen them properly because of lacking kits. Reasons being - varying demands,manual processing, in-charges unable to track and have an expected date of delivery of the kits, medicines, masks etc.

## Idea:

To solve this problem our proposed solution is to create an application from which Hospitals can directly raise requests according to their to requirement and set some threshold (by the in-charge of the respective department matter of various factors availability, need, time etc. ) value , request should be accepted by the respective in-charge within time or give reason for delay after it will be assigned to the delivery persons. If there is some delay due to limited stocks then they need to give the reason and supply according to the availability. The whole process is under tracking and hospitals are able to view whether their requests are accepted or not, how much time it will take to deliver the supplies.

## Implementation as an example:

*Dr. X is in-charge of area ABC in his area he required 10 ppe kits, 20 mask and approx 100 testing kit Before- X write application and his/her head of area going to approve then it’s approve by District head and assign to vendor and then vendor going to deliver.(Approx it Is going to take 10 days and the reason of delay is also not clear). After Implementing Online: X raises request through the app, within some assigned time Head is going to Look into that request if there is some delay he need to mention the reason for that , then he forwards the request.After all approvals it is assigned to vendor and he updates the time of delivery and other vital details, so if their's some delay or unavailability, he needs to update that as well. It can reduce about 4-5 days than that if their is delay then everyone knows the reason behind that. Also X is aw`are about request because he can track the request anytime.*
